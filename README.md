# Project 1: Real-Time Crypto Data Pipleline with Azure Data Factory and CoinGecko API

## Project Overview:

This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory (ADF) to extract live cryptocurrency market data from the CoinGecko REST API, transform the JSON response, and store the results in an Azure SQL Database. Configure an automated trigger in Azure Data Factory to extract data from the CoinGecko API on an hourly schedule and update the records in the Azure SQL Database

## Project Objectives 
- Connect Azure Data Factory to the CoinGecko REST API

- Extract and parse JSON data from the API

- Flatten nested fields using Mapping Data Flows

- Store the transformed data in Azure SQL Database

- Trigger pipeline execution hourly for real-time ingestion

## Tools & Technologies:
- Azure Data Factory

- CoinGecko REST API

- Azure SQL Database

- Mapping Data Flow (in ADF)

- Azure Key Vault (optional for API key)


## Skills Demonstrated:
- Building pipelines in ADF

- REST API integration

- JSON flattening with Mapping Data Flows

- Copying data to Azure SQL Database

- Dynamic content and parameterization

- Scheduling with triggers
